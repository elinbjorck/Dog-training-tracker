# Dog-training-tracker

When training a dog it is important to keep track of how well they know a behaviour and in what situations you have worked on the behaviour. I myself is really bad at this and figured that an app might be a good tool to make the training more organised. This product will not contain any or little information about how to teach behaviours. It will just provide ways to remember where you are and what you have donne.
