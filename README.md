# Dog-training-tracker

When training a dog it is important to keep track of how well they know a behaviour and in what situations you have worked on the behaviour. I am really bad at this myself and I figured that an app might be a good tool to make things more organised. This app will contain little or no information about how to teach behaviours. It will just provide ways to remember where you are in your training.

## Keep track of behaviors

If you have a have a dog you know that there are certain behaviours that you want them to know well. It can be things such as coming to you when called, stopping when you tell them to or relaxing on que. When working on these behaviours it is iportant to "proof" them. That means to make sure they are reliable in many different situations. To do this you must know what you have done so far and what you want to do in the future. It is also imprtent to have an image of how reliable the behaviour has been in the past. It might also be useful to be able to keep track of if and when a behaviour fails. All of this to answer the question if you are ready to move forward or do you need to take a step back? Hopefully proofing these important behaviours will allow your dog to live a life of freedom and you to have a mind at peace... and not in pieses.

## Background

When me and my partner got our first and so far only dog, we tried to learn as much as possible. But, as is always the case, we could not learn everythin at once. 3 years later we have a dog that is very reliable in many situations... but that has a few weak-spots where she compleatly ignores us. I am determined to adress these areas. As im trying to learn how to do this, it becomes clear that I have overlooked the importance of working in a stuctured way, taking small steps at a time to adress increasingly more difficult su√≠tuations.

I suck at being structured, and sometimes I take steps that are way to big, and put my dog in difficult situations, because I'm inpatient. I plan to bould this app as a tool to help me stop doing that.
